- Correct path to json files in the py notebooks from ./ to json/

- Make a mode for practicing the flags you most often get wrong, at least after having done all flags
- Save this stuff to the browser locally so you can continue where you left off
- Make settings screen where you can reset the stats, change the mode, change the metrics
- Make stats button where you can see your score and the score per flag
- Make the sliders nice on the similarities page

- All flags mode (what you start with, no repeats but still probability, timed)
- Endless mode (no timer, with probabilities)
- 15 flags mode (timed, set difficulty)
- Training mode (personalized most difficult flags, no timer, no probabilities, only repeats if mistake?, only 15 or endless?)

- Make flag colouring mode

DONE
- Make it so there's less probability of getting the same flag soon after
- Make it so your score determines the probability of getting a difficult or easy flag
