- Correct path to json files in the py notebooks from ./ to json/

- Make a mode for practicing the flags you most often get wrong, at least after having done all flags
- Save this stuff to the browser locally so you can continue where you left off
- Make stats button where you can see your score and the score per flag, where you can reset the stats

- 15 flags mode (timed, set difficulty)
- Training mode (personalized most difficult flags, no timer, no probabilities, only repeats if mistake?, only 15 or endless?)
for these modes what needs to change:
    - maybe also start screen where you can set difficulty and decide when to start
    - change probabilities for 15 and for training

- Make flag colouring mode
- Make flag naming mode
